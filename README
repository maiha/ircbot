Plugin
======

  In ircbot world, we define functions as plugin (Ircbot::Plugin).

  Instance methods:
    * reply : this method is called when privmsg event is fired,
              and reply message(the returned string) to the channel.
        args: [text, nick, message object]

    * help  : used from "plugins" plugin

  Accessor methods:

    * message : message object same as 3rd argument
    * direct? : whether the message is directly toward to the bot or not
    * config  : hash of given config file


Example
=======

  When you want echo bot, define the function as plugin first.

  plugins/echo.rb:

    class EchoPlugin < Ircbot::Plugin
      def reply(text)
        text
      end
    end


Advanced
========

  Messages are passed into plugins automatically.
  If you don't want this plugin chain, throw :done will help you.  

    config:
      plugins: a b

    class APlugin < Ircbot::Plugin
      def reply(text)
        throw :done, "This is A"
      end
    end

    class BPlugin < Ircbot::Plugin
      def reply(text)
        "This is B"
      end
    end

  BPlugin#reply will be never invoked.
